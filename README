Imagine you're pairing with a junior dev and have been tasked with the following.  Your pair will act as product owner, so you can ask any questions about requirements.

The exercise is timeboxed, assessment is based not on completing the test in time, but on how you approach the problem when pairing.

1) Count files in directory tree

    $ find src/test/resources/filecount -type f | wc -l
    12

    $ find src/test/resources/minions -type f | wc -l
    62

2) Count lines in directory tree

    $ find src/test/resources/filecount -type f -exec cat {} + | wc -l
    16

    $ find src/test/resources/minions -type f -exec cat {} + | wc -l
    4034

3) Count code/whitespace/comments of Java code in directory tree

    $ cloc src/test/resources/minions
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Language                     files          blank        comment           code
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Java                            39            435            255           1978
